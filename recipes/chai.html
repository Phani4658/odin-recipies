    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chai is like religion for many people in India. The day does not start until you have a warm cup of kadak Chai (strong tea).
        If you have any visitors or guests coming to your house,it would almost be considered rude if you don't ask for a cup of chai.
        All the fun conversations are surrounded around chai!
